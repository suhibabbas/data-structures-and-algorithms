# Depth First Traversal

The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that uses the idea of backtracking. It involves exhaustive searches of all the nodes by going ahead, if possible, else by backtracking. This recursive nature of DFS can be implemented using stacks.

## Challenge

write a function that accepts a graph and root as arguments and return a collection of nods in their pre-order depth-first traversal order

## Approach & Efficiency

time = O(n^2)
space = O(n)
